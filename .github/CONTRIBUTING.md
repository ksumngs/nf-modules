# ksumngs/nf-modules: Contributing Guidelines

Hi there!
This isn't the repository you're looking for.

If you're truly interested in nf-core modules, check out <https://github.com/nf-core/modules>.

This is just our place for keeping modules that need to differ from nf-core guidelines **OR** aren't quite ready to be published to the general nf-core registry.
